# WebStats
WebStats is a spigot plugin that can gather player statistics from multiple
sources and display it on a webpage. It can get data from the **scoreboard**,
from any plugin that stores its data in a **database**, from **PlaceholderAPI**
and player **online/AFK** status.

## [Getting started](https://github.com/Dantevg/WebStats/wiki/Getting-Started)
To use WebStats, you need:
- A Spigot Minecraft server
- A web server (note: the plugin will not work over https, so make sure the
  webpage isn't served over https either)

See [the wiki](https://github.com/Dantevg/WebStats/wiki/Getting-Started) for installation instructions.
